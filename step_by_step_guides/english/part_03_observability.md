##### Create CDE Python Resource

Navigate to the Resources tab and create a Python Resource. Make sure to select the Virtual Cluster assigned to you if you are creating a Resource from the CDE Home Page, and to name the Python Resource after your username e.g. "fraud-prevention-py-user100" if you are "user100".

Upload the "requirements.txt" file located in the "cde_spark_jobs" folder. This can take up to a few minutes.

Please familiarize yourself with the contents of the "requirements.txt" file and notice that it contains a few Python libraries such as Pandas and PyArrow.

Then, move on to the next section even while the environment build is still in progress.
